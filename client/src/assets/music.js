[00:27.31]I've been tryna call
[00:30.02]I've been on my own for long enough
[00:32.82]Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
[00:38.46]I'm going through withdrawals
[00:41.28]You don't even have to do too much
[00:44.13]You can turn me on with just a touch, baby
[00:49.67]I look around and
[00:50.87]Sin City's cold and empty (Oh)
[00:53.48]No one's around to judge me (Oh)
[00:56.46]I can't see clearly when you're gone
[01:00.82]I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
[01:06.93]No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
[01:12.13]I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
[01:18.06]Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
[01:22.48]Hey, hey, hey
[01:34.62]I'm running out of time
[01:37.32]'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
[01:40.24]So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh
[01:46.98]The city's cold and empty (Oh)
[01:49.70]No one's around to judge me (Oh)
[01:52.49]I can't see clearly when you're gone
[01:56.93]I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
[02:02.99]No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
[02:08.19]I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
[02:14.20]Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
[02:19.95]I'm just calling back to let you know (Back to let you know)
[02:22.32]I could never say it on the phone (Say it on the phone)
[02:25.69]Will never let you go this time (Ooh)
[02:30.76]I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
[02:36.74]No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
[02:41.13]Hey, hey, hey

  [00:28.41]为着什么追赶到头来有变质吗
  [00:35.34]日夜扮演开心角色吗 却总一个面对
  [00:42.41]一个 流浪哪一街角找哪份寄托
  [00:49.02]一个 闹市中却只得我
  [00:55.49]这刹那却想到至亲的说话
  [01:02.14]如若迷失请谨记回家
  [01:06.19]迷路不要惊怕
  [01:08.95]前路难关都给你招架
  [01:12.83]如像孩子那样靠着我不怕
  [01:19.72]好好的放一假
  [01:23.76]重整理内心积压再出发
  [01:36.13]望着父亲不经已白头发也斑斑
  [01:42.66]家中每一位都尚好吗 我不敢致电你
  [01:49.90]生怕 提及我的一切可会令你心挂
  [01:56.77]生怕 说到声线变沙哑
  [02:03.00]还未成功不敢说回家
  [02:06.97]要再打拼一下
  [02:09.79]同学们纷纷都已出嫁
  [02:13.76]仍在留守这地 努力往上爬
  [02:20.64]多少风雨洗刷
  [02:24.60]还可有力气抵抗吗
  [02:30.01]要记住回头看现状
  [02:33.74]会发现已过三关斩了六将
  [02:41.62]曾亦有灰色思绪在扩张
  [02:46.45]你却是往日灿烂模样
  [02:49.65]默默地为我在燃亮
  [03:21.01]如若迷失请谨记回家
  [03:24.91]迷路不再惊怕
  [03:27.57]前路难关都给我招架
  [03:31.50]犹幸能得你护荫 做你 亲手栽种的花
  [03:39.34]若跌倒纵使满身伤痕沉沦在流沙
  [03:46.08]我都不怕
  [03:47.08]也得你的双手引路回家
  [03:55.80]再都不怕
